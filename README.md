# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis
## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental company, is planning to launch an online video rental service to compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As part of the Business Intelligence (BI) team, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis to inform the company's launch strategy.

This project showcases my ability to extract insights using SQL, visualize data for business decision-making, and create a professional deliverable to share with stakeholders.

## Key Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth management team posed critical business questions to guide their 2020 strategy:

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Which countries are Rockbuster's customers based in?
Where are customers with high lifetime value located?
Do sales figures vary by geographic region?
